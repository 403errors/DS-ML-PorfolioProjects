## Advertising Project 

A machine learning project for predicting a class for a new data point based on the features. In this type of ML, column names aren't given by the organisation for client's security purposes.

## Reflection

  - This was a KNN Regression, Unsupervised Machine Learning Project. 
  - KNN regression is a simple and intuitive algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. It is also relatively robust to noise and outliers in the data. However, it can be computationally expensive to train and predict with large datasets.
  - Here are some of the assumptions of KNN regression:

    - The data is continuous.
    - The data is not linearly correlated.
    - The data is not too noisy.
  - Here are some of the benefits of using KNN regression:
    - It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.
    - It is relatively easy to understand and implement.
    - It is robust to noise and outliers in the data.
    <br>
  - Overall, KNN regression is a powerful and versatile algorithm that can be used for a variety of regression tasks. It is a good choice for problems where the data is not linearly correlated and where there is a risk of noise or outliers in the data. However, it is important to consider the limitations of the algorithm before using it.

  - Following tools have been used for making this project:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - sklearn

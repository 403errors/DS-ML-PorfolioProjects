## Reflection

  - This was a Linear Regression, Unsupervised Machine Learning Project. 
  - Linear regression is a powerful tool that can be used to predict a wide variety of outcomes, including:

    - Sales
    - Profits
    - Customer satisfaction
    - Employee turnover
    - Risk of disease
    - Test scores
    - And much more
    <br>
  - Linear regression is a relatively simple statistical method, but it can be very effective when used correctly. It is important to understand the assumptions of linear regression and to use the correct statistical tests to evaluate the results.
  - Following tools have been used for making this project:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - sklearn

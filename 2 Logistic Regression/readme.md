## Reflection

  - This was a Logistic Regression, Unsupervised Machine Learning Project. 
  - The logistic regression model can be used to predict the probability of a variety of binary outcomes, such as:

    - Whether a customer will click on an ad
    - Whether a patient will recover from a disease
    - Whether a loan applicant will default on their loan
    - Whether a student will pass an exam
    <br>

  - Following tools have been used for making this project:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - sklearn
